# Audio Resources for MightyMiner

## Sound Files Required

The following sound files are referenced in the original Java code and can be added for audio notifications:

### Failsafe Alerts
- `AAAAAAAAA.wav` - Emergency failsafe trigger sound
- `loud_buzz.wav` - Warning notification sound
- `metal_pipe.wav` - Error/problem notification
- `staff_check_voice_notification.wav` - Staff check alert

### Usage
These sound files should be placed in the `src/resources/mightyminer/audio/` directory and can be played using Node.js audio libraries like `node-wav-player` or `play-sound`.

### Implementation
```javascript
const player = require('play-sound')();

// Play failsafe alert
player.play('src/resources/mightyminer/audio/AAAAAAAAA.wav', (err) => {
    if (err) console.log('Could not play sound:', err);
});
```

### Note
Sound files are optional and the bot will function perfectly without them. They enhance the user experience by providing audio feedback for important events.
